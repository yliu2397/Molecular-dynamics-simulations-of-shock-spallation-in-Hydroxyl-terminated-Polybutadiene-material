Impact Velocity and Temperature Effects on the Shock Wave Propagation and Spallation of Hydroxyl-terminated Polybutadiene: A Molecular Dynamics Study
In this project, we are using molecular simution to investgate the shock propagation and spallation in the Hydroxyl-terminated Polybutadiene (HTPB) materials. 

This repository contains the MD model used in our recent paper (see below). This repository contains the LAMMPS files required to run MD simulations of shock propagation and spallation of polyurethane. The input files are available above (“shock.in”). 
A brief figure showing the model we established in our paper is available here.
