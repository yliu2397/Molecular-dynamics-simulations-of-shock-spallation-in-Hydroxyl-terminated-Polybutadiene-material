Impact Velocity and Temperature Effects on the Shock Wave Propagation and Spallation of Hydroxyl-terminated Polybutadiene: A Molecular Dynamics Study
In this project, we are using molecular simution to investgate the shock propagation and spallation in the Hydroxyl-terminated Polybutadiene (HTPB) materials. 

A brief figure showing the model we established in our paper is available here.
